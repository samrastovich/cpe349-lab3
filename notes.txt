Each assembly line has n stations, numbered j = 1, 2, .... n
Jth station on line i = S[i,j]
Entry time e[i]
Exit time x[i]
For rush, chassis still goes through n stations, but chassis may switch from one AL to another
Time to transfer chassis away from line i after going through station S[i,j] is t[i,j] where i = 1, 2 and j = 1, 2, .... n-1
